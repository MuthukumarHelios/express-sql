# express-sql

simple login page using express and sql 

I have generated  only with REST api not with [veiws] you can check with the postman ONLY 

Every thing is deveoped from the scratch -->my own scenario


##check whether you have already installed with mysql  
after installed create a database;

for see the database schema you can check the routes/controller.js ==> register action

---->use Database mobileapp;

#git clone https://github.com/Muthukumars1994/express-sql.git
#cd express-sql
//install dependencies

#npm install


#npm start

-->magic happends in the postman api with login using bcrypt
